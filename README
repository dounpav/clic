clic - Command Line Interface Calculator
========================================

A simple commandline calculator (shell) that uses Dijkstra's shunting-yard
algotithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) for parsing
and calculating/evaluating the arithmetic expression.

Supported operators:
	- addition +
	- subtraction -
	- multiplication *
	- division /
	- parenthesis ( )


Building clic
=============

In order to build the clic, cd to the clic repository and run make. After the
make is run successfully, a clic executable should appear.
$ cd clic
$ make
gcc -c stack.c -Wall
gcc -c clic.c -Wall
gcc clic.o stack.o -o clic -Wall
$ ls
LICENSE  Makefile  README  clic  clic.c  clic.o  stack.c  stack.h  stack.o
$

Running clic
============

After the clic is built, run ./clic to launch clic. When the clic is running
a shell like prompt should appear

$ ./clic
>>>

Now you can use the prompt as a normal calculator. To evaluate the expression
press <Enter>.

Examples:

>>> 1+1
= 2.000000
>>>
>>> 5*(-3)
= -15.000000
>>> 0-3
= -3.00000

To exit the clic shell type exit.

>>> exit
